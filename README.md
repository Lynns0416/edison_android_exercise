# Fact app
This app shows a fact via [fact free api](https://catfact.ninja/fact).

## Issues
It works, but does not satisfy the requirements below.

### Must
We need to
- Show the `length` from the api response
- Access data via `Data layer`
- Add local data source (`DataStore`)
  - To show the previous fact for the next visit
- Add dependency injection by `Hilt`
- Add proper testing after introducing `Data layer` and `Hilt`
- Make the UI state immutable as much as possible

### Optional
If we have a time, we want to
- (Design) Add the `Top app bar` and update the design 🏰
- (Testing) Add [JUnit5](https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5) and `mockk` 🤸
- (Gradle) Add a `version catalog` 📗
- (Future growth) `Modularize` the app ✌🏻
- (Future growth) Add `Domain layer` 🚴‍️
